        <p class="mb-4">Hi there!</p>
        <p class="mb-4">I'm glad you're here. My journey with coding started when I went to university. That's where I fell in love with web development. I enjoy the mix of creativity and logic that comes with coding, and I love finding solutions to problems.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">I believe there are many challenges that technology can help solve, especially in South Africa and my rural village. I'm passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact in my community.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">In my projects, I aim to create solutions that are not only functional but also easy to use. I think technology should be accessible to everyone and improve people's lives.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and working together to solve problems and build a better future.</p>
